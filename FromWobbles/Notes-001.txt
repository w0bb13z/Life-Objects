The entire idea for the mock ups is that I want to create a base
set of objects that at minimum consist of a well-thought-out set
of constants that ultimately create an electronic "skeleton" of
sorts for each object.

For now each object's file should include the general imports,
followed by a class object containing a set of constants-- which
are passed in through the __init__, as well as a dictionary to
link the lowercase string version of each attribute name, and
lastly the more-or-less copy and paste .get() and .set() funcs
that are used to interact with them.
