The idea behind this Pr0j3kt is to encapsulate and compartmentalize
the various aspects of Life and Existance as we currently know it.

In this new generation of people, I can't wait to see all of the young
wide-eyed devs-to-be who hate my generation of Yahoo Chatrooms pedophile
teasing-sociopaths as much as we hate the previous generation of losers
who didn't have the internet to begin with. But this is a serious idea,
and a serious project. We are developers here, and maturity is a virtue.

For the omni-20-language-wielding-autistic-demons who possess power beyond
that of my own:

    "wtf slow down im coming omg.
     some of us r people...
       Not me. But some of us."   -w0bb13z

First, I will start by attempting to create a basic class object for
the following things:

  [X] Person              [(4/21/2017) ( 7:21am PST) "Done."    -w0bb13z]
  [X] Animal              [(4/21/2017) ( 9:41am PST) "Done."    -w0bb13z]
  [+] Residential House   [(4/21/2017) (11:24am PST) "Started." -w0bb13z]
  [-] Commerical Business
  [-] Item For Sale
  [-] Social Event

We will ultimately be striving to create a polymorphic, yet simplified
set of objects that can be used to for-all-intents-and-purposes in the
generation, calculation, and simulation of the entirety of existance.

This sounds crazy. It' is crazy. I'm crazy. Let's rock.

                    inside of list. 'iA' isn't used. Didn't break the
                    program, and these are just preliminary object sets
                    I'm creating as rough layouts to figure out what
                    some of the basics look like, so i didnt' fix it.
